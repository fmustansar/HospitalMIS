# `Hospital MIS` â€”

A hospital wants to manage their patients and has chosen us to create a patient management functionality.

Used Angular.JS to create an application that allows a user to add and list patients.

Means we will have 1 login page, 1 list view (Grid View) and 1 Add page.


How to run the application:
----------------------------
Just check out the code of this repo and perform the following step(s).

1- Bower install
2- Run http-server through npm in the main directory of this application
    (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
3- access http://192.168.50.55:8080/ in most cases but please try to use the ip and port that http-server is referring.
